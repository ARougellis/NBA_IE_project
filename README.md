# NBA_IE_project
In this project, a team and I answer the question, "Does Performance Correlate with Higher Salary in the NBA?"

IE Project for Statistics 525: Regression Analysis at Umass Amherst using R. 

A description of the data we used can be found under the file `nba_df.README.txt`. My team and I split up the $30$ variables amongst us. The data I was in charge of can be seen in the file `nba_df.cvs`.

This project was broken up into 4 parts
- pt.I : getting to know the data
- pt.II : analysis of variables
- pt.III : further analysis and write-up
- pt.IV : presentation 

In **pt.I** : 
Got aquainted with data. Finding outliers and mising data, performing basic visualizations, transforming data, etc. 

In **pt.II** : 
In this part, I go about analyzing my data by creating regression models and finding standard deviations, residuals, estimators, coefficients of determinations, and more. With these, I created many graphs and plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and more. All this to try and find the variables with the most significant correlation to a greater salary. 

In **pt.III** : 
In this part, we finish up our analysis, combine all our findings, and creaate a multi-linear resgression model. Woth this we found the varibles to have the greatest significance to salary are `Age`, `GS`, `MP`, `ThreeP`, `TRB`, `AST`, `STL`, `PTS`. With this, we then created a final write up and in the next part we presented or findings to our class.
