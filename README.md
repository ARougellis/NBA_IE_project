# NBA_IE_project
In this project, a team and I answer the question, "Does Performance Correlate with Higher Salary in the NBA?"

IE Project for Statistics 525: Regression Analysis at Umass Amherst using R. 

A description of the data we used can be found under the file `nba_data.README.txt`. My team and I split up the $30$ variables amongst us. The data I was in charge of can be seen in the file `nba_data.cvs`.
